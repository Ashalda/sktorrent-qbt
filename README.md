# sktorrent-qbt

A multipage qBittorrent plugin that can search form sktorrent.eu



## Installation

Install by downloading sktorrent.py and adding it to your qBittorent search plugins or by pasting this address into your qBittorrent client

```bash
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ashalda/sktorrent-qbt/refs/heads/main/sktorrent.py
```
    
## Usage
It may take a bit because SkTorrent has 24 torrents on one page and the program checks every page, so it adds by 24 to your search count every time it checks new page
```
Just search and wait, it's not that difficult :)
